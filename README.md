CarouselView
============

Carousels are annoying, but maybe useful sometimes?

I accidentally made a master detail app. That was a mistake. However, if you go to the detail screen, you can see the carousel in action. It works as expected with swipes. It does not loop around. It has a hard start/stop point.
